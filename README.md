Project Description
The Patient Checker Web Application allows patients to update their daily health status easily. If medicines are not taken, the patient feels unwell, or an emergency button is pressed, automatic alerts are sent to the caretaker. The system provides secure login using email and password with separate dashboards for patients and caretakers.

The Problem statement
Elderly and chronically ill patients often forget to take their medicines and update their health status regularly. In emergency situations, caretakers are not informed immediately, which can lead to serious risks. Manual monitoring methods are unreliable and cause delays in timely care.
